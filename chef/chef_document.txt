ChefDK-> chef development kit should be installed in server(windows,linux),
         it act a workstation to upload the chef cookbook and interaction with chef-server and enivironment path should be set 
starter kit -> Should be downloaded from chef server it will help to connect the workstation with chef server from your chef workstation
         ( for all the chef activity with that chef-server)
chef Agent -> will be running on nodes and based on the convergence it will communicate with chef server for available update

Bootstraping chef node:
PS C:\Users\kristhim\Desktop\thimma\demorepo\chef\chef-starter\chef-repo> knife bootstrap 54.149.74.229 --ssh-user ubunt
u --sudo --identity-file C:\Users\kristhim\Desktop\thimma\keys\chefpem.pem -N ec2-54-149-74-229.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

Chef commands:

chef generate cookbook first-cookbook 
knife node list
knife upload cookbook first-cookbook
berks install -> one time berks support strong version control 
berks upload -> on every upload change the verion sin metadata.rb file 
chef generate attribute <path to cookbook> <name_of_the_attribute>
chef generate attribute . default
chef generate recipes . myreciep
chef generate file . myreciep
chef generate template . message.txt # Edit the contect dynamially 
cookbook-file -> to copy file from source to destination directory 

#create role in roles directory and update them ( rolese are collection of sequence runlist will be applied to the server )

knife role list
knife role from file .\myrole 
knife role bulk delete '^server'
knife node run_list add <public_dns> 'role[myrole]'
knife node run_list add <public_dns> 'recipe[cookbookname::recipe]'

#enivironment in the chef used to maintain the cookbook version, change in the cookbook version include the run_list which is set and applied on each convergence

knife enivironment from file .\enivironments\dev.rb
knife enivironment list 
knife enivironment bulk delete '^server'


<%= "my name is #{$ruby}" %> - dynamic content in the file
During every convergence node object will be created by Ohai and it collect all the system value 
# if node['platform'] == 'ubuntu' 
#     default['first-cookbook']['package_name'] = 'apache2'
# else node['platform'] == 'redhat'
#     default['first-cookbook']['package_name'] = 'httpd'
# end

default['first-cookbook']['package_names'] = ["tree","git","nano"]
Attribute has following type and
