	./configure

Once the command has completed the patch update can begin.

A few additional notes for Serviceguard systems.

The Serviceguard system's cluster status can be viewed using the following command:
	cmviewcl -v

Additionally, before shutting down the cluster make sure that any file systems exported to other nodes are no longer mounted. The following command can be used to shut down the cluster:
	cmhaltcl -f -v
